What's Taiga's Open Source License?
</h5>
</div>
<div id=collapse-license class=collapse aria-labelledby=heading-license data-parent=#accordion>
<div class=card-body>
<p>There are important considerations governing the <a href=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html>Affero GPL license</a> in use by Taiga. Please be sure you are familiar with your rights and obligations before starting to work on the Taiga code.</p>
<p>Since the open source license covering Taiga is AGPL, you can freely clone/fork the repo and make any modifications you want. Just remember the basic condition that the Affero GPL brings to the table: any Taiga instance must easily provide to all users a link to the source code that is running that particular Taiga service.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t make any changes to the code, the link is pretty simple, it&rsquo;s just a link to <a href=https://github.com/kaleidos-ventures>Taiga&rsquo;s github page</a>. But if you intend to make adaptations or changes, you must provide a (de-facto) zero-cost way to obtain the complete modified source code. The easiest way would be to fork the repo on github and point your users to that forked repo (you can place that link in the documentation somewhere).</p>
<p>Our repo is quickly evolving so we suggest you keep careful track of our changes, that way you can easily benefit from our own improvements &ldquo;for free&rdquo;. Some users have decided to use our Taiga cloud instance together with our public API and only develop a separate integration layer that effectively lives outside the Taiga source code. By doing this you can &ldquo;forget&rdquo; about changes taking place at the Taiga source code.</p>
<p>Your needs will dictate which option suits you better.</p>
<p>Please read the <a href=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html>AGPL 3.0 license</a> covering Taiga.</p>

What's the difference between public and private projects?
</h5>
</div>
<div id=collapse-differencepublicprivate class=collapse aria-labelledby=heading-differencepublicprivate data-parent=#accordion>
<div class=card-body>
<p>Under Project SETTINGS, you have probably seen the Public/Private toggle button. Also, upon project creation you are asked about this.</p>
<p>Private projects are projects that are accessible only to project members. You still have the option to allow for other Taiga users or anonymous users (including search engines) to interact with the project if you allow for that using the <strong>External User</strong> role under SETTINGS > PERMISSIONS, but this is not enabled by default.</p>
<p>Public projects are projects that are forced to be at least viewable for non members and anonymous users (including search engines) through <strong>External user</strong> role. They also show up under Taiga&rsquo;s <strong>DISCOVER</strong> page.</p>
<p>The configuration flexibility allows for some overlap. You decide what&rsquo;s best for your project. Please note, Public Projects do not count for the paid plans on taiga.io, they are always free of charge regardless of team size or number of public projects.</p>

<p>Sure! The Taiga community is awesome and helps us translate the Taiga user interface into more than 20 languages.</p>
<p>To see if your language is supported, simply go to <a href=https://tree.taiga.io/user-settings/user-profile>EDIT PROFILE</a> and pick your choice under <strong>Language</strong> drop down.</p>
<p>If the language is meant for Right-To-Left setup, it will also activate this mode.</p>
<p>Our text editor has support for Right-to-Left setup too, so you can combine both options as you please.</p>

Why is my project blocked on taiga.io?
</h5>
</div>
<div id=collapse-payment-whyprojectblocked class=collapse aria-labelledby=heading-payment-whyprojectblocked data-parent=#accordion>
<div class=card-body>
<p>We are sorry to hear that. The most probable reason any project would be blocked is because the owner of that project did not subscribe in time to an appropriate paid plan. The project hasn’t been deleted at all, it is simply not accessible for the time being.</p>
<p>Taiga.io does not immediately block projects upon unsuccessful payment, it will continue to attempt the payment three more times during the subsequent 5 days after the first failed attempt. Taiga will also send an email for every unsuccessful payment attempt but the only recipient of those emails is the project owner.</p>
<p>If you are not the project’s owner, we suggest you contact them. Please tell them to follow the instructions on Taiga.io to subscribe to a paid plan. Your project will immediately be available again.</p>
<p>If you are the project owner and you receive one of such emails, proceed to change the debit/credit card details as an invalid or expired debit/credit card is number #1 reason for a failed payment. Updating the debit/credit card details with a valid one before the projects get blocked should automatically prevent the blocking process. If the projects are already blocked, entering valid debit/credit card details immediately restores the account status and allow projects to be accessible again. You can simply go to your<a href=https://tree.taiga.io/user-settings/contrib/subscriptions>user settings subscription settings</a>. If you encounter any problem simply contact <a href=mailto:support@taiga.io>support@taiga.io</a> and we will give you instructions to follow so you can subscribe to a paid plan.</p>

Can I enjoy partial sprint progress even if user stories are not closed but some tasks are?
</h5>
</div>
<div id=collapse-scrumsprintprogresstasks class=collapse aria-labelledby=heading-scrumsprintprogresstasks data-parent=#accordion>
<div class=card-body>
<p>Scrum agile technique states that if an estimated user story is not finished, <strong>it can&rsquo;t be counted</strong> towards a sprint&rsquo;s user story points completion.</p>
<p>The rationale is simple, <strong>Scrum sprints care about finished work</strong> that can de properly validated during the <strong>Sprint&rsquo;s Demo</strong>. Partial or unfinished work, while perfectly acknowledgeable, is not meant to change the progress metrics that are geared towards delivered value, not time spent.</p>
<p>This very binary approach frustrates some agile teams that <strong>prefer progress charts to represent any partial progress</strong>.</p>
<p>Some Taiga users have asked to be able to assign points to user stories tasks and keep track of them towards progress. This way, as an example, a user story could be 10 points split up in 2 tasks 5 points each. They would argue that <strong>a finished 5-point task could make the user story 50% finished towards sprint and burndown metrics</strong> even if the user story is not finished.</p>
<p>Product-wise, we continue to evaluate the risks of allowing partial or continuous progress metrics. For the moment, we strongly suggest you read <a href=https://blog.taiga.io/four-agile-antipatterns-and-a-big-fat-lie.html>Agile Antipattern: &ldquo;All for sprint&rsquo;s speed&rdquo; in our blog</a>. There are <strong>ways to address the underlying problem</strong> (and need) without the partial-progress approach.</p>

Who has to pay to use taiga.io?
</h5>
</div>
<div id=collapse-payment-whohastopay class=collapse aria-labelledby=heading-payment-whohastopay data-parent=#accordion>
<div class=card-body>
<p>Taiga is an Open Source platform. At the same time, we provide a freemium cloud/SaaS offer so you can use our own infrastructure to host all your projects and teams. Depending on your use, we may charge for this service.</p>
<p>But who has to actually pay?</p>
<p>A project owner that needs to go beyond the FREE PLAN needs to pay a monthly or yearly amount based on <a href=https://www.taiga.io/#ugNVXkW1sS8mgQDer7GNGKkZchV3gH6v>Taiga&rsquo;s Pricing Policy</a>. This project owner is responsible for the payment of all their projects' team members. Project owners only pay once per team member, regardless of how many projects those team members belong to or the overall number of private projects a project owner administers.</p>
<p>As a project owner, you can always check which Taiga users are counting towards your paid subscription under <a href=https://tree.taiga.io/user-settings/contrib/subscriptions>user settings subscription settings</a>.</p>
<p>Regular team members, even if they enjoy the ADMIN role in a number of projects, do not pay. They are taken care of by their Taiga project owner.</p>
<p>Of course, a Taiga user could be a regular user under a paying Taiga project owner and, with that same Taiga account, be project owner to others. In that case, this Taiga user would pay for their respective projects' team members.</p>

How can I invite my team over to Taiga?
</h5>
</div>
<div id=collapse-invite-team class=collapse aria-labelledby=heading-invite-team data-parent=#accordion>
<div class=card-body>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to Taiga and would like <strong>to invite your team</strong> to the platform, you need to do so <strong>after you have created a project</strong>. Once you have created a project, you can go to SETTINGS>MEMBERS and add them. Invites will be sent by Taiga to all of them to join <strong>both Taiga and your project</strong>. If you invite team members that are already Taiga users, they will be immediately added to the project and they will get notified as well.</p>
<p>Inviting team members to Taiga requires inviting team members to at least one project where you have ADMIN or OWNER status, that is, you can access the SETTINGS panel for that project. Once they have a valid Taiga user, they can be invited to many other projects and they can use Taiga based on their account type.</p>

<div class="card-header pointer" id=heading-transfer-project>
<h5 data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse-transfer-project aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse-transfer-project>
How can project ownership be transferred?
</h5>
</div>
<div id=collapse-transfer-project class=collapse aria-labelledby=heading-transfer-project data-parent=#accordion>
<div class=card-body>
<p>Transferring the project ownership of a project is possible both ways; someone with Admin status requests the project ownership or some project owner invites a project ember to become the new project owner.</p>
<p>This is done by accessing the <strong>Request ownership / Transfer ownership</strong> option under SETTINGS > PROJECT DETAILS. It will trigger a request for confirmation to the other party, who can accept or decline the petition.</p>
<p>Since the difference between Project Owner and Admin status is just formal (both roles can do almost everything), you don&rsquo;t need to transfer a project for any practical reasons. This action is usually linked to a project owner leaving the project or the company in which such project is managed. On tree.taiga.io, it is relevant for the billing information, since only project owners are considered potentially billable (depending on their account type).</p>
</div>

<h5 data-toggle=collapse data-target=#collapse-transfer-blockedproject aria-expanded=true aria-controls=collapse-transfer-blockedproject>
Can I transfer the ownership of my blocked tree.taiga.io project?
</h5>
</div>
<div id=collapse-transfer-blockedproject class=collapse aria-labelledby=heading-transfer-blockedproject data-parent=#accordion>
<div class=card-body>
<p>Transferring the project ownership of a blocked project might be an unexpected burden to the transferee so we would like to avoid that at all costs. The simplest and fastest solution is to simply subscribe to the minimum paid plan on a monthly basis and then do the project ownership transfer normally (the other person would still have to accept clicking on an link sent to them via email).</p>
<p>On exceptional occasions we have an alternative plan that will take much longer, which is that both you and the transferee send an email to <a href=mailto:support@taiga.io>support@taiga.io</a> explicitly requesting the project ownership transfer for one or more projects where both of you are already members. That will trigger a manual action on our side but you might have to wait a several days.</p>

</h5>
</div>
<div id=collapse-settings-customfields class=collapse aria-labelledby=heading-settings-customfields data-parent=#accordion>
<div class=card-body>
<p>Taiga includes optional custom fields in its administration panel. It will provide teams with a flexible input to fit in their workflow.</p>
<p>Users with administration permissions will be able to create new custom fields for their project Epics, User Stories, Subtasks and Issues.</p>

<p>Simply go to your Project Admin section > Attributes > Custom fields and add, remove or edit any of those for your choice of Taiga entities.</p>

What is this Iocaine thing in Taiga and how should I use it?
</h5>
</div>
<div id=collapse-iocaine class=collapse aria-labelledby=heading-iocaine data-parent=#accordion>
<div class=card-body>
<p>The iocaine powder is a reference to the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">The princess Bride</a>. It features a colorless, odorless, and deadly poison from Australia. Character Westley spent two years building up an immunity to iocaine powder. He uses it to trick Vizzini in their battle of wits.</p>
<p>The iocaine feature means that a user is out of their comfort zone. It could signal that a team member is learning a new ability required to close a task. It can also mean that this user is over-reaching or over-stretched.</p>
<p>Iocaine is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>We all recognize that reaching beyond our boundaries is a good and healthy thing albeit stressful and uncertain. The best way of taking risks is to be sure your team members are aware that you are doing so. They may be more inclined to forgive faults, be supportive, lend a hand, or be kind!</p>
<p>We use it internally, and we have learned to respect when people indicate they are taking an Iocaine dose!</p>
<p>When a user takes iocaine it will be shown in the tasks card as a small poison bottle, and your user picture will be tinted to a purple color.</p>
<p>When you see this in a taskboard task you will notice that a colleague (or yourself!) are out of their comfort zone and closing the task could use some help or a little bit more time.</p>
<p>The team member who is taking care of the poisoned item should be the one deciding if it&rsquo;s iocained or not. For a team member a task could be trivial (without iocaine) and really difficult for another (a lot of iocaine).</p>

Why is there no Time Tracking?
</h5>
</div>
<div id=collapse-notimetracking class=collapse aria-labelledby=heading-notimetracking data-parent=#accordion>
<div class=card-body>
<p><em>Tough question. There is no consensus about time tracking in agile methodologies. Some people think agile methodologies are not meant to include time tracking, while some really need time tracking for a variety of different reasons. Either way, Taiga is built to accommodate multiple use cases.</em></p>
<p>But, of course, agile methodologies are meant to be malleable, so even if we decided to not implement time tracking as a feature in Taiga, teams are implementing it by using workarounds (like adding hours in the task or user story title, etc.)</p>
<p>To accomodate these practices we came out with something that could fit in any team workflow and solve many different problems: custom fields.</p>
<h3 id=solution-1-set-up-custom-fields>Solution 1: Set Up Custom fields</h3>
<p>You can create <a href=https://resources.taiga.io/features/customisation/>custom fields</a> in issues, tasks and user stories to track everything and make beautiful reports with your favourite spreadsheet and the <a href=https://resources.taiga.io/faqs/howtoreporting/>CSV reports functionality</a>.</p>
<h3 id=solution-2-using-toggl>Solution 2: Using Toggl</h3>
<p><a href=https://www.toggl.com/>Toggl</a> is a time tracking app operated by Toggl OÜ that is integrated with Taiga.io. You only need to sign in in Toggl.com and install the <a href=https://github.com/toggl/toggl-button>Chrome extension</a> to use it over Taiga.io.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href=https://github.com/olegerm>Olegerm</a> who developed this integration between Toggl and Taiga.io</p>
