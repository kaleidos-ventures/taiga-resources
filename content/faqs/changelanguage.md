Sure! The Taiga community is awesome and helps us translate the Taiga user interface into more than 20 languages.

To see if your language is supported, simply go to [EDIT PROFILE](https://tree.taiga.io/user-settings/user-profile) and pick your choice under **Language** drop down.

If the language is meant for Right-To-Left setup, it will also activate this mode.

Our text editor has support for Right-to-Left setup too, so you can combine both options as you please.

To know more about Taiga's localisation efforts and language support, please visit our [Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/taiga-agile-llc/public/).
