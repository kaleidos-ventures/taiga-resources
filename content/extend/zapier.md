If you don't have programming experience to use our [API](https://docs.taiga.io/api.html) we can recommend using our integration with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/taiga/integrations). Zapier is a tool that allows you to connect Taiga with other tools or with Taiga itself using visual workflows. Go [here](https://zapier.com/apps/taiga/integrations) for more info on our Zapier integration.
 
### Create Taiga automations and/or connect Taiga to hundreds of other apps with Zapier

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/taiga/integrations) lets you create Taiga automations and/or connect Taiga to 4,000+ other web apps or services. Automated connections are called Zaps and you can set them up in minutes with no coding to automate your day-to-day tasks and build workflows between apps that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

Each Zap has one app as the **Trigger**, where your information comes from and which causes one or more **Actions** in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically.
 
### Getting Started with Zapier

Sign up for a free [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/taiga/integrations) account, from there you can jump right in. To help you hit the ground running, here are some popular pre-made Zaps.
